  <h1>Sadayo Kawakami</h1>
  <p>Hello I am a teacher at Shujin Academy. The Phantom Thieves, especially
    Ren, has been a big help at bringing my life back together.</p>
  <p>I started out as his loving maid at Ren's place *giggle*. When I opened up to him
    slowly, I told him my problems.</p>
  <p>I worked two jobs as a maid and teacher to pay back a student's parents for
    indirectly killing their son</p>
  <p>How the hell is it my fault? I was just encouraging him to take more time for his studies! The parents kept hounding me for money! GRR!</p>
  <p>Randomly when I saw the parents on another day, they suddenly had a change of heart and told me I would not have to keep paying them anymore.</p>
  <p>That's when I realized that Ren did this for me, as he was the only one who I confided in with this</p>
  <p>Thank you Phantom Thieves!! I am forever a fan! Keep in touch Ren! ðŸ˜˜</p>

  <h1>Hifumi Togo</h1>
  <p>Greetings! My name is Hifumi Togo! Some of you may know me as the infamous shogi player.</p>
  <p>I'm here to tell you that I was one of those the Phantom Thieves have helped</p>
  <p>My mother was the person in question when it came to my problems.</p>
  <p>Ren happened to show by the church one evening and was very eager to learn shogi from me.</p>
  <p>As we met up, we got to know each other, and told him about how my mother would rather have me model than do what I love. She's deadset on it for me.</p>
  <p>And as many of those helped by PT's probably have guessed, my mom all of a sudden told me how wrong she was to force modeling on me and to go with my heart on what I wanted to do.</p>
  <p>This is literally night and day! Thank you Phantom Thieves! And thank you especially to Ren-kun. â™¥</p>
